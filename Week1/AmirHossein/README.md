## 1. Application Programming Interface (API)

Whenever we talk about software development, we'll inevitably end up talking about `Application Programming Interfaces`, or APIs for short. But what is all the fuss about?

The first thing we need to understand is that API means different things to different people. Some people use it to refer to a complete application (frontend + backend), others use it to only refer to the server, or there's even people who use it to refer to any part of an application (i.e. "frontend API"/"server API")

For our purposes it's useful to stick to one definition, while keeping in mind that others will use it differently. Here's the definition we'll use:

```markdown
An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface to an application. It's the point of connection for any other application, in order to communicate with it. The API defines the terms of how to connect to it.
```

You can think of an API as a wall socket:

![Wall Socket](./../assets/API.png)

As you can see on the image, the wall socket has a certain shape. This shape defines in what way something can connect to it. If you were to use a plug that had a different shape, it would never fit and thus never be able to connect. But if you had a plug that was in the correct shape, you got plug it in and proceed to connect to whatever is behind the socket (which in this case is the service of electricity).

In a way, you could say that an API is the frontend to an application. It's similar to the frontend part of a website. The biggest difference is, however, that instead of giving a way for human users to interact with it, an API gives a way for other applications to interact with it.

- [APIs for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us)

### Public/private APIs

There are 2 different types of APIs: **public** and **private** APIs.

An API is **public** when software companies publish parts of their software to be freely used by developers from the outside world. If you were to integrate the Facebook API as a login system in your application, you would be using their API as a public API.

Conversely, there are also **private** APIs: software companies that grant access to parts of their backend applications to internal developers only, in order to develop new services to be used either internally or for the outside world.

In reality, there are way more private than public APIs. This is because it's usually in the company's best interest to keep their code base hidden from the public eye: it would be like giving your secret recipe away for free.

Keep this in mind: in the real world **programming is only a means to serving a business end**. In this course you're learning how to program, to make nice-looking, well-functioning applications. However, this is always done within a business context. This is to say: does this software lead to making more money/gaining more popularity/or the achievement of any other business goal?

- [The Business Impact of Private, Partner and Public APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk50AYGvs-g)

### Connecting with APIs

A big part of what applications do is **moving data from one place to another**. Let's say you are on the HackYourFuture website and feel like donating some money. First of all, that's very nice of you! You head out to the website and click on the donate button. You type in the amount and click on "donate". You'll notice you immediately get redirected to a different website, namely checkout.stripe.com. How did Stripe know how to do this?

It's because the HackYourFuture website sends a **HTTP Request** to Stripe. The request basically says "Hey Stripe, some user from the HackYourFuture site wants to make a digital payment, can you handle that?". As a response Stripe answers "Of course, send the user to this specific URL and I'll take it from there!".

> Anytime a request to an API is made this is called a `HTTP Request`. However, in practice people use different terms for the same thing. Synonyms for `HTTP Request` are `API call/request`, `Network call/request`, `Web request/call` or`HTTP call`. Which do you prefer?

A HTTP Request has to be made using a special method. The browser gives us two of them: `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch API`. `XMLHttpRequest` (or XHR for short) is the older, more verbose method. It looks like this:

```js
// 1. Create a new XMLHttpRequest object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// 2. Configure it: GET-request for the URL /article/.../load
xhr.open('GET', '/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load');

// 3. Send the request over the network
xhr.send();

// 4. This will be called after the response is received
xhr.onload = function() {
  if (xhr.status != 200) {
    // analyze HTTP status of the response
    alert(`Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}`); // e.g. 404: Not Found
  } else {
    // show the result
    alert(`Done, got ${xhr.response.length} bytes`); // response is the server
  }
};

xhr.onprogress = function(event) {
  if (event.lengthComputable) {
    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes`);
  } else {
    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} bytes`); // no Content-Length
  }
};

xhr.onerror = function() {
  alert('Request failed');
};
```

This way of making HTTP Requests is outdated (and not recommended to use), but it's good to be aware of it as you might still see it in old code bases.

The newer way of making HTTP Requests involves using the `Fetch API`. You'll learn more about that next week!

For further study of how to make HTTP Requests, check out the following resources:

- [Working with APIs in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI)
- [Making HTTP Requests in JavaScript](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/making_http_requests_js.htm)

## 2. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)

AJAX is the idea that data can be loaded into a webpage without refreshing the entire website. It's a **web development technique** when building websites, NOT a technology or programming language.

The term is an acronym for `asynchronous JavaScript and XML`. Let's pick that apart:

- Asynchronous JavaScript often refers to the act of using an asynchronous function to make an HTTP Request to fetch data. As we've learned in the previous module, an asynchronous function allows the browser to do multiple things simultaneously. In this way we fetch data in the background, while the user is still able to navigate the webpage.
- XML is a data format used to send information from a server to a client, and vice versa.

This technique was used back in the days when the web wasn't that advanced. Back then we used XML is the standard format we used to structure our data in. Nowadays we have replaced it with another data format: `JSON`.

### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

`JSON` stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a very JavaScript-like data format. Here's a small example:

```json
{
  "first name": "Noer",
  "last name": "Paanakker",
  "age": 28,
  "address": {
    "street address": "Strekkerweg 79",
    "city": "Amsterdam",
    "postal code": "1033 DA"
  }
}
```

If you look closely it almost looks exactly like a regular JavaScript object. There are 2 big differences: (1) in a JSON object everything is turned into a string (als known as "stringified"), and (2) it's not tied to the JavaScript language. Actually, many other languages can work with JSON!

In AJAX we make a HTTP Request to a web server, that then responds back with information to be used in the frontend. Generally speaking, this data will be send in `JSON` format. The web server "stringifies" (makes into a string) the data to be send first before it sends it.

### Stringifying and parsing JSON

JSON is the modern web standard data format to send and receive data in. In order to make something into JSON format we need to `stringify` it: make the whole object into one string. Luckily, JavaScript gives us a way to do this:

```js
const noer = {
  firstName: 'Noer',
  lastName: 'Paanakker',
};

const noerJSON = JSON.stringify(noer);

console.log(noerJSON); // Result: {"firstName":"Noer","lastName":"Paanakker"}
```

Here's another way of looking at the "stringifying" process: let's say you want to send your mother a gift, a brand new HackYourFuture T-shirt. Would you just put the shirt right into the mailbox, like that? Of course not! You would wrap it up nicely and put it into a box. Then you put it in the mailbox and off it goes!

This act of putting something into a box is what's happening when we `stringify` data (either on the client-side or server-side).

After the JSON data has been send, the receiver has to be able to interpret it. This process of making JSON interpretable by the programming language within that environment is called `parsing`. As we're using JavaScript, it doesn't seem like a big stretch. But what if we're using some other programming language like Python or Java?

To follow our analogy, this is basically your mother unpacking her T-shirt from out of the box you put it in!

Again, in JavaScript we can use another method gained from the global `JSON` object in order to `parse` our JSON data:

```js
const noer = {
  firstName: 'Noer',
  lastName: 'Paanakker',
};

const noerJSON = JSON.stringify(noer);

const noerParsed = JSON.parse(noerJSON);

console.log(noerParsed); // Result: { firstName: 'Noer', lastName: 'Paanakker' };
```

Nowadays we use JSON to perform asynchronous operations using JavaScript. So, technically speaking, the term would actually be AJAJ. However, the industry has decided to stick with the term AJAX to refer to these processes. Keep that in mind whenever someone asks you about it!

Go through the following to learn more about JSON and AJAX:

- [Learn JSON in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM)
- [JSON Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI1CWzNtE-M)

### XMLHttpRequests (XHR)

Traditionally, in order to make use of the AJAX technique we need to make use of a special type of object, called `XMLHttpRequest`(shortened to XHR). It's an object predefined for us by the `window` object in the browser.

> The `window` object is the most top-level object available to us in the browser. It contains the `document`, which contains all the HTML/CSS and JavaScript we write. Besides this, the `window` also contains a lot of other things we use when writing frontend code: `setTimeout()`, `alert()` and it even contains a reference to the `console` (from which we get `console.log()`). Try it out in the console if you want to see for yourself!

By creating a new instance of this object we can start making HTTP requests!

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

Making XHR requests is the primary way of making HTTP Requests. It allows us to send and retrieve data from other services.

However, this method is outdated and we use more modern means now (using the `Fetch Web API` or a solution like `axios`). You will learn about that next week!

## 3. Modules & Libraries

### What's a module?

A `module` is a part of an application that contains usually a single functionality. For example, a single function that has only 1 job could be considered a module. For example:

```js
function addNums(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

If this little function has its own dedicated `.js` file and you can import it into another file, it's a module!

When developing applications you'll always be writing multiple functionalities in order for your software to work as expected. These can be written all in one file, and that would still work. The browser/operating system would be able to interpret and execute it anyway. But for you, the human, it's very hard to keep overview of what is happening at what level of the application. Can you only imagine having to look through one big file of 1000's of lines of code, just to find

In order to keep a better overview, we can choose to **modularize** our application. This means: splitting it up into smaller parts (modules) that, in theory, all work independently.

However, creating better overview is not the only reason. Among other reasons, modules make a developer's job easy by:

- Making the application easier to maintain, by making it more readable and thus easier to modify
- Isolating individual blocks of code, in order to make errors more easily traceable
- Encouraging the developer to write code in a way that makes it reusable

For more information about this, go through the following:

### What's a library?

If you've ever written code you know how easy it is to duplicate it: you just copy and paste it.

Modules are small blocks of code that make up a functionality. But what if you have a bunch of modules that collectively aim to solve a bigger problem, like creating [data visualizations](https://d3js.org/) or make DOM manipulation easier ([jQuery](https://jquery.com/))?

For this we use a `library`: code that a developer (or a team of developers) has written in order to solve these bigger problems within an application. A library, typically, contains a collection of modules that work together in order to solve a bigger problem.

> Like many things in programming, people use various terms to describe the same thing. In the case of `library`, you'll often hear it spoken of as `package`, `namespace` or `dependency`.

Why do we use libraries? We use them to help us make building applications easier. Think of it like building a house: in theory you could do it all by hand. But as you can imagine, this is highly inefficient and time-consuming. So instead we use tools to help us out. These can be small tools (like a hammer or screwdriver) or bigger ones (like a concrete mixer or wheel barrow).

In the real-world developers use libraries all the time. They either make them themselves, or make use of public ones. If the original developers of a library have published their code, through a platform like [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) for example, it can legally be used in custom applications for free. This is called **open-source**: the source code is open for any to look into, use and modify to their own needs.

Examples of common JavaScript libraries are the following:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

When researching these it's important to ask yourself two questions:

- What problem does the library solve?
- How does it fit in the architecture of the software I am trying to make?

### An example of a library

In a previous section we discussed APIs and the importance of being able to make HTTP Requests so that we can communicate with them. We have seen that we can use the `XHR` object to do so. In this section we'll discuss a `library` that makes this process easier for us. It's called [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), a JavaScript library that allows us to make HTTP Requests in an easier way.

Here's what it looks like in action:

```js
const axios = require('axios'); // We have to load in the library first

// Make a GET request to get user data from the Pokemon API
axios
  .get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')
  .then(function(response) {
    console.log(response);
    // Do something with data
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
    // Do something with error
  });
```

Any library that exists is developed to solve some problem. The main problems `axios` aims to solve are the following:

1. how to make an `HTTP request` in an easier way
2. how to write more readable asynchronous code

Here's how `axios` solves problem 1:

- It abstracts away/simplifies the XHR logic needed to make a HTTP Request and wraps it inside of functions that are more descriptive (like `axios.get` or `axios.post`, to indicate a GET and POST request)

Here's how `axios` solves problem 2:

- It makes use of the Promise structure, which will allow you (the developer) to "chain" operations in a readable and intuitive way.

### How to use a library

Now that you've learned about the utility of libraries, let's talk a little about how to approach using a library. Keep in mind that this is not the only way to do it, but it will set you off on a good start.

1. **Do your research**. Doing research means finding out more about the library. Is it new? Is it fully functional? What do other people say about using it? Is it backed by a sizable developer community? Does the library have a GitHub/NPM page?
2. **Read the documentation**. If code has been published for everyone to use, most likely the developers have written a guide on how to use it. This is called `documentation`. After doing your research delve into it and try to figure out what the philosophy and usages of the library are.
3. **Try out a basic example**. A basic example can usually be found in the documentation. Copy and paste it into an empty file for yourself and try it out. It's best to try it out in isolation first, so that you can learn exactly what makes it work. Then slowly start playing around with it: change names, move lines of code.
4. **Try to integrate it with your own code base**. Once you've tried it out it's time integrate it into your own code. Figure out where to best put it. The documentation can help you out with that. Look at other developer's code and see how they use it. Watch videos or read articles online.

As an example, try it out with `axios`. To help you out, here are some resources:

- [Documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Axios Crash Course | HTTP Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LyagkoRWYA)
